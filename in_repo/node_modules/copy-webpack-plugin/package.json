  "readme": "## Copy Webpack Plugin\n\nThis is a [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) plugin that copies individual files or entire directories to the build directory.\n\n### Getting started\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev copy-webpack-plugin\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n`new CopyWebpackPlugin([patterns], options)`\n\nA pattern looks like:\n`{ from: 'source', to: 'dest' }`\n\n#### Pattern properties:\n* `from`\n    - is required\n    - can be an absolute or path relative to the context\n    - can be a file or directory\n    - can be a glob\n* `to`\n    - is optional\n    - if not absolute, it's relative to the build root\n    - must be a directory if `from` is a directory\n* `toType`\n    - is optional\n    - is ignored if `from` is a directory\n    - defaults to `'file'` if `to` has an extension\n    - defaults to `'dir'` if `to` doesn't have an extension\n* `force`\n    - is optional\n    - defaults to `false`\n    - forces the plugin to overwrite files staged by previous plugins\n\n#### Available options:\n* `ignore`\n    - an array of files and directories to ignore\n    - accepts globs\n    - globs are evaluated on the `from` path, relative to the context\n\n### Examples\n\n```javascript\nvar CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');\nvar path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    context: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),\n    plugins: [\n        new CopyWebpackPlugin([\n            // {output}/file.txt\n            { from: 'from/file.txt' },\n            \n            // {output}/to/file.txt\n            { from: 'from/file.txt', to: 'to/file.txt' },\n            \n            // {output}/to/directory/file.txt\n            { from: 'from/file.txt', to: 'to/directory' },\n\n            // Copy directory contents to {output}/\n            { from: 'from/directory' },\n            \n            // Copy directory contents to {output}/to/directory/\n            { from: 'from/directory', to: 'to/directory' },\n            \n            // Copy glob results to /absolute/path/\n            { from: 'from/directory/**/*', to: '/absolute/path' },\n            \n            // {output}/file/without/extension\n            {\n                from: 'path/to/file.txt',\n                to: 'file/without/extension',\n                toType: 'file'\n            },\n            \n            // {output}/directory/with/extension.ext/file.txt\n            {\n                from: 'path/to/file.txt',\n                to: 'directory/with/extension.ext',\n                toType: 'dir'\n            }\n        ], {\n            ignore: [\n                // Doesn't copy any files with a txt extension    \n                '*.txt',\n                \n                // Doesn't copy any file, even if they start with a dot\n                { glob: '**/*', dot: true }\n            ]\n        })\n    ]\n};\n```\n\n### Testing\n\n[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin/latest)\n\nRun `npm test`\n\n### License\n\nMIT",
